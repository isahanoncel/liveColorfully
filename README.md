# If You Don't Know Your Local Ip Address
Windows :
Open up the Command Prompt via your Windows Start menu. Type in “ipconfig” and hit Enter. Look for the line that reads “IPv4 Address.” The number across from that text is your local IP address.

Mac :
First, click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner of your desktop and open System Preferences. Then, click on Network. Find your connection type—wifi or Ethernet—and click on it. (It should have a green dot if it’s active.)
Look to the right, and you’ll see a sentence that looks like “...is connected to ..... and has the IP address...” The number that follows is your laptop’s IP address.

# how does it works
liveColorfully exchanges data instantly between server and client. <br>
You can see the number of active users on top of screen. <br>
if you press anywhere of the screen,liveColorfully will change background color randomly for all of users with the same time.
